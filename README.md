### regulation part
- [X] fix kernal size = 3 problem
- [X] writing fine-tune part
- [X] read the pytorch lightning pruning part
- [ ] change the code to before
- [ ] try the resample, padding and interplot method
- [ ] try resample + cropping
- [ ] do cropping and patch-based
- [ ] adding data augmentation fine tune
- [ ] adding one more layer without concat
- [ ] try dice and BCE with weight
- [ ] try denseUnet
- [ ] Be more careful with the learning rate
- [ ] try leave one out
- [ ] select value module type = 1

### later to do 
- [X] write the predict part, and using the mp4 part
- [X] fix mp4 problem
- [X] update the mp4 quality
- [X] when test, the label do not do the data augmentation resize part
- [ ] tune the data agumentation's parameters
- [ ] fix dice score = inf problem
- [ ] make the epoch more smaller / make the every_epoch_avl = fraction
- [ ] write test part on the 1069 data
- [ ] why there is a warning in mp4 part
- [ ] make it into a pip package
- [ ] look at the data after cropping and resize, and directly resize's difference?
- [ ] why every time train, the train loss would suddenly go up a lot after a long time?

### Reading
- [ ] reading nnUnet again
- [ ] read about nnUnet learning rate
